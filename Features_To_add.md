Champion view:

1. More friendly user interface. I.e. Dynamic titles to indicate what is being filtered and what the data in the visualizations represent.
2. Upload file/Select data option
3. Reorganizing some of the code to have a bit more structure - mainly the computations done before the R shiny app.


Overall view:

1. Still need to implement
