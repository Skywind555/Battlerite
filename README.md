Dashboard deployed on AWS viewable at http://shiny.battlerite.site/Personal-Projects/
***Currently not deployed due to expensive cost***

Note: The _V2 files are basically a slightly more complex script that includes information such as the number of R, EX1, EX2, and ultimate usages. I only managed to collect around two days of data with the new script located in the Data2 folder before API shut down. 

Otherwise, the data in the Data folder represents data pulled using the Get_Data script.

Images files taken from https://github.com/StunlockStudios/battlerite-assets/tree/master/mappings/assets

The Image_Conversion script converts Image files from the Image folder to png and resizes them to 130x130 pixels saved in the ImagesConverted folder.
