region.xlsx was created through manual lookup of all Battlerite servers and finding the geographical location of it (matches Valve)

English.txt is the same as English.ini as found on https://github.com/StunlockStudios/battlerite-assets/blob/master/mappings/67104/Localization/English.ini
and renamed as a .txt file

All other files created with the Get_Reference_Files script
